# Food-for-value
1. Problem statement

The absence of knowledge regarding appropriate machinery and techniques for value addition further exacerbates these issues, leading to economic inefficiencies and lost opportunities for local farmers and laborers.

Addressing these gaps is crucial to enhancing the agricultural value chain, reducing food waste, and improving the livelihoods of local communities.
